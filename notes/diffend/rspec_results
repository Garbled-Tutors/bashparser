We created a file using one of BashParser's specs (original), then we opened it with vim and saved without changing anything (modified).
This produced an unexpected difference between the output of the two files.

Using original as input we BashParser created this result

""
"egestas id vitae quam"
""
"Maecenas eget quam id elit vestibulum"

using cat on original produces this

""
"Proin tristique, libero fringilla adipiscing iaculis"
""
"Maecenas eget quam id elit vestibulum"

using cat on modified produces the same as BashParser

inspecting the hex shows only a small difference towards the end
